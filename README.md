# React Native WinRT

React Native WinRT is a module for [React Native for Windows](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/) developers who want to call native (non-XAML) WinRT APIs in their apps. It uses components from [xlang](https://github.com/Microsoft/xlang) to [parse metadata](https://github.com/microsoft/winmd) for public or private WinRT COM APIs and generate JSI (JavaScript Interface) wrappers for [C++/WinRT](https://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt) types at compile-time. The code generator was itself derived from `cppwinrt.exe`.

This repo generates the [react-native-winrt npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-winrt) as well as the [Microsoft.ReactNative.WinRT NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ReactNative.WinRT) for specific versions of React Native Windows. 

## Getting started

Refer to the [usage docs](docs/USAGE.md) for instructions on how to use React Native WinRT in your React Native Windows app to call projected WinRT APIs in JavaScript.

### Sample code

See the [sample app](/samples/RNWinRTTestApp/) for an example of using React Native WinRT to consume WinRT APIs.

## Versioning

The versioning scheme for React Native WinRT aligns with versions of React Native for Windows.
A new major version of React Native for Windows is not guaranteed to be supported by a mismatched version of React Native WinRT.
For example, a React Native for Windows 0.67 app may not be compatible with **react-native-winrt** 0.66.* package versions due to potential breaking changes.

React Native WinRT currently supports the following versions of React Native for Windows: 

- [release/0.72](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-winrt/tree/release/0.72)
- [release/0.71](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-winrt/tree/release/0.71)
- [release/0.70](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-winrt/tree/release/0.70)
- [release/0.69](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-winrt/tree/release/0.69)
- [release/0.68](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-winrt/tree/release/0.68)
- [release/0.67](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-winrt/tree/release/0.67)
- [release/0.66](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-winrt/tree/release/0.66)
- [release/0.65](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-winrt/tree/release/0.65)
- [release/0.64](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-winrt/tree/release/0.64)
